# Space attack
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: Space attack is a video game created in GameMaker that is set to reproduce the "8-bit" arcade style games 
 that were created in the '90s. The purpose of this game is to hit asteroids with your spaceshuttle and avoid getting hit by the 
 big rocks. I chose some minimalist sprites in order to create the effect of an old arcade game. I am passionate about how old 
 games were made and I have a particular interest in arcade games.
